Observations:
- Recursive approach has O(n) time complexity
- Iterative approach has O(1) time complexity
- Recursive approach uses O(n) space for call stack
- For large periods, iterative is more efficient
- Recursive approach is more educational and readable

============================================================
             ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
============================================================
RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS IN THIS TOOL:

1. Future Value Calculation:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n = periods
   - Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursion stack
   - Recurrence: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)

2. Present Value Calculation:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n = periods
   - Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursion stack
   - Recurrence: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)

3. Growth Projections:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n = periods
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for both recursion and array
   - Recurrence: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)

4. Power Calculation (for loan payments):
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) using divide-and-conquer
   - Space Complexity: O(log n) due to recursion stack
   - Recurrence: T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)

5. CAGR Calculation (Newton's method):
   - Time Complexity: O(log precision) - converges quickly
   - Space Complexity: O(log precision)
   - Converges quadratically

COMPARISON WITH ITERATIVE APPROACHES:
- Most iterative versions have O(1) space complexity
- Time complexity often similar (O(n) vs O(n))
- Recursive versions are more intuitive for financial formulas
- Stack overflow risk for very large periods (>1000)

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Recursion limit set to 1000 periods for safety
- Performance tracking included for analysis
- Input validation prevents common errors
- Suitable for typical financial planning horizons
